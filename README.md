# Dark-Theme-Toggle-Button
Simple dark theme toggle button

**Why?**
- This is a mini self-development project. I needed to develop a theme toggle button for a calculator app, so I made this file to experiment with how to do that and it became its own mini project.

**Features**
- It's a very basic app with only one main user feature - the ability to toggle between a day and night theme. When toggle button is clicked, the backgroun, content of the h1, and the color of the button itself will change.

**Languaged Used**
1. HTML5
2. CSS3
3. JavaScript ES6

**External Resources Used**
1. Google Fonts 
2. Fonts Awesome (for icons)

**Things I learned / Skills I Improved Upon**
1. Dynamically add and remove class to conditionally show/hide DOM elements
